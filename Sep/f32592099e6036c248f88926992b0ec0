Tuesday, a night many football lover will struggle to forget. Bafana Bafana has been beaten once more by their opponent.Moses Mabhida Stadium was filled to capacity as spectators expected Stuart Baxter s boys to turn things around but that never happened.Cape Verde has now leapfrogged Bafana Bafana in Group D after beating Baxter and his boys in their own backyard 2-1.Early pressure from the hosts saw Hlompo Kekana try one of his famous long range strikes after seven minutes but the Sundowns man s effort went slightly wide of the target.Bafana showed their attacking intent with the likes of Hlompo Kekana, Bradley Grobler, and Tokelo Rantie dominating in the early stages.Cape Verde played a quick corner and Ryan Mendes nearly caught out Wayne Sandilands with a speculative effort which sailed just over the bar.A golden opportunity fell for Grobler in the opposition s small box but his free header failed to trouble Josimar Dias in the Cape Verde goal in what was the last chance of the half.Themba Zwane and Tokelo Rantie combined very well and placed Rantie in a good position to have a shot at goal and he did just that, but the ball went just wide. Cape Verd took the lead on the stroke of the 50th minute with a beautifully struck free kick by Garry Rodrigues to silence the home crowd.The hosts seemed out of ideas and were punished again by an outrageous long range strike from Rodrigues to double his team s lead.Baxter s men were on the back foot for most of the second half but a late surge from the home side saw them pull one back through a deflected Andile Jali effort.It was a little too late as the visitors held Bafana off to collect maximum points and complete the double over their opponents.Many fans are already calling for the sack of the Bafana Bafana coach and SAFA is set to look into the matre as the team s presence in Russia 2018 is non- negotiable.
