A Zimbabwean prophet is raising more questions than answers after selling ballpoints to congregants during his church service on Sunday, claiming that they are anointed.Prophet Sham Hungwe of House of Grace International Church, distributed hundreds of pens to people who are about to sit for exams.The pens which cost at least R2 were being sold for different amounts ranging between R15 and R300 depending on what you can afford.Prophet Sham said those who are sitting for their exams only needed faith and the anointed pen to pass. It is anointed and I declare passes when your children sit for exams; when you sit for your exams , he said.With the examinations around the corner, the pens sold like hot cakes and congregants were seen scrambling to the pulpit to get them. They (pens) are said to work for anyone who is sitting for any test. My son is not very bright and I think this will help him. With the knowledge he has acquired and this pen from the man of God, I think it is going to work. One female congregants parted ways with more than R150 for a pen as they were told the more they give, the more their faith and the more their children will pass.
