When his daughter Hlengiwe Thubana started having labour pains on Friday night, she was rushed to KwaMhlanga Hospital s maternity ward. But instead of admitting her, the nurses were allegedly watching a video on a cellphone and referred her to KwaMhlanga Clinic.At the clinic, Hlengiwe was referred back to the hospital as she was a minor, but because of her exhausted state she was placed in a room at the clinic for the night. The next day an ambulance arrived at about 11am, said Elliot.His daughter gave birth on arrival at KwaMhlanga Hospital, but there was no joy for the family as the baby girl died immediately after birth. Doctors told Elliot the baby died due to breathing problems.The furious father from Suncity, near KwaMhlanga told journalits said he was planning to sue the hospital for negligence. They should have helped her but those lazy nurses were watching a video. Hlengiwe told reporters the three nurses denied ever seeing her. After the incident the nurses called me to another room. When they came to me in the ward they had their name badges on, but in the room these were removed, she claimed. Mpumalanga Health spokesman Dumisani Malamule said the patient arrived with paramedics as a referral from KwaMhlanga Clinic for poor progress of labour. She delivered a live female baby but the baby changed condition immediately. Efforts to resuscitate her failed, he said.
